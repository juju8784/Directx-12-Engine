# GTemplates

Convenient template projects for developers using Gateware.

To compile a template on your platform:

	download CMake: https://cmake.org/download/

	Open the CMake GUI (or use cmd line if preferred)

	Point it at the specific template's folder and 
	output to a build folder of your choice (ex: ./build)

	Click "Configure" and select your preferred environment then 
	hit "Generate" and check your output folder for your solution

The IDEs we typically test with:
	Win32: Visual Studio
	MacOS: XCode
	Linux: CodeLite

Certain templates require additional dependencies, so be sure to check
the included README.md in each specific template to make sure you have them.
A good rule of thumb is to just read the "Gateware/README.md" to get setup.
